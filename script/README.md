# Rosetta Testing and Upgrade Validation Guide

This guide is to support the testing and validation of Rosetta for compatibility with the flow-go module dependency. This 
Rosetta implementation integrates core, internal components from the flow-go repo subjecting Rosetta to upstream breaking changes.

When using `emulator` or `localnet` it will be necessary to follow all steps. For 
testnet or mainnet there are relatively less steps since originator accounts have already been created, are funded and 
in active use. 

## Prerequisites 

If contracts, scripts or transactions are being changed in some way, it may be necessary to learn [Cadence](https://cadence-lang.org/), Flow's smart contract language.

### Install Flow CLI

```bash
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://storage.googleapis.com/flow-cli/install.sh)"
flow version
```

### Check python3 and dependency installation

`python3` is used for testing with one external dependency

```bash
pip install click
```

### Configure target environment

Before starting ensure that variable constants in the project `Makefile` are updated to reflect the target environment and 
desired configuration.

## First time environment setup

When testing on `emulator` or `localnet` it will be required to bootstrap and fund originator accounts. If testing 
a live network first time setup steps are only required if the network is new. 

If using `emulator` it should be started.

```bash
flow emulator --contracts --persist --verbose=true
```
Be aware that when using the `--persist` flag the emulator will preserve state between starts locally in `flowdb/` directory.
If the `flowdb/` directory is deleted for a full state reset then bootstrapping will need to be run again

### Running localnet

If using `localnet` it will need to be started. Localnet is a full Flow network with 9 containers, each one representing an instance 
of one of the Flow node types used in the network. These are automatically built into images and run as containers on Docker. Detailed guidance on 
running `localnet` is provided in the [README](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/tree/master/integration/localnet). Assuming that a specific 
release version is being used, you will need to clone `flow-go` and checkout that version.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:onflow/flow-go.git
cd flow-go
git checkout tags/v0.37.26  ## change as required
```

Keep the version number used to hand since it will need to be matched with the `go.mod` flow-go dependency used in Rosetta later on. 

### Bootstrap originator accounts

Create one or more originator accounts. You will need to set a unique `ACCOUNT_NAME` as an env var for each account created. It may 
be necessary to update the configured ${FLOW_JSON} with the appropriate service [account details](https://developers.flow.com/tools/flow-cli/flow.json/configuration#accounts) 
for your target environment before proceeding.

```bash
ACCOUNT_NAME=root-originator-1 make gen-originator-account
```
This target undertakes the following for the target environment:

* Generates public and private key pairs for use by Flow and Rosetta 
* Uses the generated public key to create a new Flow account to serve as an originator
* Updates ${FLOW_JSON} with the new account and private key JSON block
* Adds the new address to the originators list in ${ROSETTA_ENV} config JSON
* Updates ${ACCOUNT_KEYS_FILENAME} with a single CSV row entry with the following columns
  * `name, Flow public key, Rosetta public key, Flow private key, account identifier`

### Fund accounts

Use this target to fund the newly created originator accounts from the network service account. 

```bash
make fund-accounts
```

* Iterates row entries in ${ACCOUNT_KEYS_FILENAME} and funds 100 FLOW to each one


## Testing, validation and upgrade sequence

Once the environment is bootstrapped with funded originator accounts then it's possible to start testing. It's advisable 
to start with a confirmed baseline, namely ensuring that the Rosetta version you are starting with works with the `flow-go` 
version currently on testnet/mainnet. 

1. Baseline test of main branch Rosetta against current emulator
2. Baseline test of main branch Rosetta against testnet
3. Update `flow-go` and other required dependencies which also need updating
4. Build, deploy and start `localnet` using the same versions of `flow-go` etc
5. Test and validate Rosetta against `localnet`
6. Release new Rosetta version
7. Coordinate with Coinbase to deploy new version during scheduled network upgrade

### Check Environment before testing

The remainder of this guide assumes that the required bootstrapping of the target environment is done and that either
the emulator, or localnet, are running (unless testing a live network). If you have previously run Rosetta and encounter this 
error on startup:

```go
ERROR   Unexpected parent hash found for block 8345eb03aa4959d3652fb485e3a91f981672276973ecee9b9f2f43ac0cc55aa9 at height 1: expected c77c642ceaa5b3e4b3265da14ead25361c9cd903652b34fc022494fc73f2177b, got 5b105616db0b3c75a7efc4e97ae09d30b48cb0d679221ba9cbdcb7aa29c86dcf
```

Delete `data/` folder which stores state from previous runs and will cause this error to occur when bringing up Rosetta server:

### Build Rosetta

```bash
make build
```

### Start Rosetta

```bash
./server localnet.json  ## use appropriate Rosetta JSON configuration for your target environment
```

If successful it should log something like this

```bash
âžœ   ./server localnet.json

```
Rosetta will continue syncing blocks from Flow Access nodes until it has caught up, which may take some time on long-lived networks. 

Before continuing to test you must wait for Rosetta to confirm it has reached the tip: 

```bash
2025-02-05T17:17:33.701-0800	INFO	Indexer is close to tip
```

### Create originator derived accounts

If this is the first time testing in this environment, or if the Flow environment has been reset, you will need to create at least two originator 
derived accounts. These _must_ be created via Rosetta rather than through the `flow-cli` or other non Rosetta transactions.

```bash
NEW_ACCOUNT_NAME=derived-account-1 ORIGINATOR_NAME=root-originator-1 make rosetta-create-sub-account
```

### Transfer funds

Now we use Rosetta to trigger a transfer into the newly created derived account. 
```bash
RECIPIENT=derived-account-1 ORIGINATOR_NAME=root-originator-1 make rosetta-transfer-funds
```
